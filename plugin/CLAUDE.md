# FFFlow Plugin

A Claude Code plugin providing a complete development lifecycle — plan, work, audit — scaling from informal prose specs (L0) to full FFFlow rigor (L3).

**Build spec:** [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). That document is authoritative for this plugin's design. Skill design, naming, and review decisions are anchored to it.

## What FFFlow is

Three artifacts, three roles, three locations:

| Artifact | Tense | Lifespan | Location | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec** | Present | Evergreen | Codebase (`docs/specs/`, `specs/`, or per-module CLAUDE.md) | Behavioral contract |
| **Plan** | Future | Transient | `/tmp/ffflow-plans/<project-hash>/<slug>/` | Design decisions for one change |
| **Issues** | Imperative | Transactional | Issue tracker (GH/Linear/Jira/markdown) | Work-to-be-done |

The spec describes end state. The plan describes the path. The issues are the chess moves.

## The L0–L3 dial

Same skills at every level. What changes:

- **L0** — informal prose specs, standard TDD, lint+test gates
- **L1** — structured prose, hexagonal layering, defect-driven specs
- **L2** — Gherkin scenarios, spec-first development, contract enforcement
- **L3** — full FFFlow: RID traceability, mutation testing, four quality gates

A project declares its level in `.ffflow/config.yaml`. No config = L0.

## Architectural invariants

These shape every skill. Full text in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) §2.

1. **Three artifacts, three roles, three locations** (above).
2. **Specs and tests move together.** A spec entry without a test is documentation. A test without a spec entry is opaque.
3. **Three planning entry points, one downstream.** `characterize`, `plan-chat`, and `audit --plan` all produce plans. They converge on `plan-breakdown → plan-capture → work`.
4. **Methodology dial shapes formality, not workflow.** Same skills, different artifact format and gate strictness per level.
5. **Audit is the keep-honest layer.** Per-type auditors are small and focused. The `audit` skill coordinates only.
6. **Red/Green TDD is the execution discipline.** Spec → red → green → refactor → spec update → gates → PR. Same loop at every level.
7. **Naming convention: memorable prefix first.** `/audit --type claude-md`, not `claude-md-audit`. `plan-chat`, not `chat-for-planning`. Optimize for what a tired developer types.
8. **Skills only.** No commands. No agents. No MCP servers. Every entry point is a skill.

## Build order

The plugin is large. Built in phases — see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) §10.

- **Phase 1** — L0/L1 planning spine (`init-ffflow`, `plan-roadmap`, `plan-chat`, `plan-breakdown`, `plan-capture` (with `github-issues` cartridge), `plan-status`).
- **Phase 2** — Execution (`work-issue`, `work-epic`, `work-fanout`, `autopilot`, `tdd-loop`, `self-review`, `worktrees`, `stack` (with python + typescript cartridges), `stack-init`, `stack-assess`).
- **Phase 3** — Audit foundation (`audit` skill with `claude-md` cartridge active; `ci-gates`).
- **Phase 4** — Brownfield + characterize (`characterize`, `adopt-ffflow`, `defect-driven-specification`).
- **Phase 5** — Spec-level rigor (additional `audit` cartridges: `spec`, `char-tests`, `architecture`, `refactor`; `hexagonal-architecture`, `refactor` skill).
- **Phase 6** — L2/L3 methodology (`writing-specs`, `spec-first-development`, `contract-enforcement`, `rid-traceability`, `total-specification`, `quality-gates`, `audit`'s `rid` cartridge).
- **Phase 7** — Breadth (remaining capture backends, stacks, justfile patterns, dev tools, `zero-tech-debt`, `yagni`, `audit`'s `tech-debt` cartridge).

## Cross-cutting conventions

When authoring or editing skills, enforce these. Full text in `docs/architecture.md` §7.

- **Plan Mode discipline.** Skills that interact about future actions must NOT invoke `EnterPlanMode`. State this explicitly at the top of the skill body. Required for: `plan-chat`, `plan-breakdown`, `characterize`, `work-issue`, `work-fanout`.
- **Decision-marker convention.** Open decisions in plans/specs are marked with `?` at the start of the line, or in a `## Open decisions (?)` section. Resolving a decision **removes** the marker (rewrite `## ? D1` → `## D1 (resolved)`); don't leave archival `## ?` headings — the `plan-breakdown` gate keys on open markers and stale ones trip it. Full rule: `docs/architecture.md` §7.2.
- **PR-checkpoint protocol.** `work-issue`/`work-fanout` post a one-line summary after every PR; pause for confirmation after every 2 PRs in an unattended session.
- **Local-validation gate.** `work-issue` does not push a non-spec-only PR without either a local repro/smoke pass, or an explicit statement in the PR body explaining why local validation wasn't possible.
- **Idempotency.** Every state-writing skill detects existing state and updates rather than duplicating.
- **Resume-ability.** Long-running skills persist state to disk between meaningful steps.
- **Memorable typeahead names.** Distinctive word first.
